Welcome to our unique take on the classic Snake & Ladder game — but this time, it’s not just about luck!

🔧 What’s Different?
🧠 Players make choices that affect gameplay — bringing strategy into the mix.

🎨 Custom board design support — players can build their own boards or load predefined ones.

👥 Developed as a team project, emphasizing collaboration, problem-solving, and clean object-oriented design (OOP).

🚀 Why It Matters
This wasn't just a coding project — it was a full learning journey!
We challenged ourselves to go beyond the basics, incorporating:

Creative thinking

Logical gameplay design

Teamwork and version control

Real-world application of OOP principles

We're proud of what we've built — and even more excited for what comes next.
Built with ❤️ by an amazing team.
